Subject: [PATCH 224/277] dwc_otg: Fix a regression when dequeueing isochronous
 transfers

In 282bed95 (dwc_otg: make nak_holdoff work as intended with empty queues)
the dequeue mechanism was changed to leave FIQ-enabled transfers to run
to completion - to avoid leaving hub TT buffers with stale packets lying
around.

This broke FIQ-accelerated isochronous transfers, as this then meant that
dozens of transfers were performed after the dequeue function returned.

Restore the state machine fence for isochronous transfers.
