Subject: [PATCH 299/299] net: lan78xx: Request s/w csum check on VLAN tagged
 packets.

There appears to be some issue in the LAN78xx where the checksum
computed on a VLAN tagged packet is incorrect, or at least not
in the form that the kernel is after. This is most easily shown
by pinging a device via a VLAN tagged interface and it will dump
out the error message and stack trace from netdev_rx_csum_fault.
It has also been seen with standard TCP and UDP packets.

Until this is fully understood, request that the network stack
computes the checksum on packets signalled as having a VLAN tag
applied.
